            How many departments are you starting with? We are all out. It is a
            full-fledged hospital, and we have all the departments. From the
            major medical departments to subsidiaries. major departments such as
            medicine, surgery, paediatrics, and obstetrics and gynaecology. And
            under these departments are some other specialised departments. In
            surgery, we have neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery, and plastic
            surgery. And we intend to provide services in all of those
            departments. In the medical department, we have different
            specialties, such as neurology, cardiology, and psychiatry. And we
            have consultants from every sub-specialty that can attend to any
            patient that walks in here. Paediatrics is mostly general, and we
            have paediatricians, O&G, and consultants. And in terms of
            diagnostics, we have radiology departments, where we have MRI, CT
            scan, X-ray, ultrasound, and echocardiography to ECG as well. And in
            the laboratory, there are lots of other services that we provide,
            and the list will be very, very long, but I believe I can call our
            laboratory department a standard laboratory one where most of our
            tests can be conducted.

            How many doctors and nurses are you starting with? So right now, we
            have opened 50 beds for business, trying to understand how the flow
            of service will change depending on patronage. We have nearly 20
            permanent doctors, and we also have over 70 nurses at the moment.
            They include general nurses, midwives, and other sub-speciality
            nurses, like dialysis nurses, accident emergency nurses, and theatre
            nurses, like pre-operative nurses. So we have over 70. And there are
            lab scientists, lab technicians, pharmacy technicians, pharmacies,
            and other housekeeping staff as well.

            Nigeria has been known for those who can afford it to seek treatment
            abroad rather than all. What will attract them to SAHAD Hospital?
            What makes you different? Why should I come to SAHAD rather than go
            to India? Israel or the U.S.? So, what I skipped in the interview
            was my professional skills and how I got involved in SAHAD in the
            first place. My business initially was medical tourism. Our company,
            Foodside Health Care Limited, is into medical tourism, healthcare
            project management and development, and healthcare consulting
            services. What we had done over decades was send patients from
            Nigeria to many different countries for healthcare operations, so I
            have vast knowledge on the subject area of medical tourism.Our
            initial involvement in SAHAD was development. So Foodside Health
            Care helped in developing this project to its completion. And then
            after that, we renewed our agreement to manage the facility too. So,
            the agenda is to do what is called reverse medical tourism, knowing
            fully well what medical tourism entails. In terms of infrastructure
            and equipment, SAHAD Hospital has all it takes to do over 70% of
            what patients seek abroad. And then, with our network of hospitals
            and doctors abroad, we have many doctors who are willing to leave
            their countries to come to Nigeria to provide our service.
          </p>

          <p className="font-serif">
            So what international connections and expertise is SAHAD hospital
            bringing? Right now, in our list, we have around 12 consultant
            surgeons from India who are willing to come to SAHAD Hospital to
            provide services. So how we are going to do it is when we gather
            patients that require a specific service from a specific expert. We
            fly them in, and they operate on the patients here, which is going
            to be cheaper for the patients because of the money for the visa,
            flights, the attendant that will go with the patient, the cultural
            shock when you get to where you are because you don’t know anyone,
            the accommodation costs have been completely waived, plus even the
            surgery itself will be a bit cheaper, but you are going to get all
            the expertise. And we have the service of telemedicine here, where
            those specialists can get in touch with you even before they come
            here through telemedicine. And all your results—everything that we
            are providing here—they have beforehand, so when they come, they
            will maybe operate for 3–4 days, finish all the patients, and fly
            back. So, like I was saying, these surgeons are ready to fly in and
            do all the operations we have booked for them because the majority
            of the operations that make people fly are not emergency operations
            or something they will plan. So, we can have one patient today; we
            give them early next month, hoping that before them we have 3–4-5,
            and then the surgeon comes in, and within that period, we do all of
            them and then go back. It’s cheaper for the patients.

            We have learned that SAHAD Hospital has built some patient quarters;
            what are those? We have accommodations for patients that come from
            far away; they don’t have to start searching for hotels around. We
            have accommodations within the hospital where people can stay and do
            all their preliminary investigations and be outpatients before
            surgery. And after surgery, they can still go back to the
            accommodation and return for a post-op check-up before they are
            finally discharged home. So, I think with the rich knowledge in the
            industry that I have on my team, we will be able to deliver
            effective and efficient services that people do not really need to
            go abroad. What are the challenges you foresee? The big challenge we
            have in this industry is the high rise of commodities. The point I
            make here is that we intend to provide more affordable services
            here, but it’s kind of very difficult to even set a price for
            anything. I’ll give you an example. In my other hospital, we did an
            X-ray at 3,000 Naira, and the X-ray film was 70,000 Naira for 100
            pieces. So, which means each patient will take 700 Naira home. When
            you finish the X-ray, we give them the film. Now, those same pieces
            of X-ray film are worth 270,000 naira. So, if the price is still
            3,000 Naira, the patient goes home with 2,700 Naira. And you cannot
            continue hiking prices as you go to the market. So, there is a
            serious challenge: people may not be able to afford health care if
            there’s no stability in the market for certain consumables that we
            require to operate. So, that is a big challenge that I see that
            might hinder the operational services that we are providing because,
            no matter how we want to keep the service affordable, we will not
            want a situation where the business is not sustainable as well.
            That’s the big challenge.

            Have you partnered with some global pharmaceuticals? We have not
            yet, because we’re just starting. So, we’ll be seeing all the
            opportunities out there. Many will say that for a private specialist
            hospital, SAHAD Hospital will be for the rich. Is that so? Well, the
            focus of SAHAD hospital is not on a specific niche of people,
            because when you look at the hospital setting in Abuja, there are
            certain hospitals where you can’t even go. After all, you know that
            you’re not likely to afford it. So, our range of services has
            provided a way for everybody to come and acquire the services. When
            it comes to admission, we have some large wards that are affordable
            for the community to afford, and we have more specific rooms where
            those who can afford them can come. Even in the living rooms, we
            have a general living room, and we also have individual living rooms
            for everyone to come to. SAHAD Hospital is targeting the general
            public in its entirety. Thank you very much for your time! You are
            most welcome!
